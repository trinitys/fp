MY DEAR SIR

The inclosd is an attested Copy of Genl Schuylers Letter to the
President of the Congress. It needs no Comment. How far the
Massachusetts state deserves the Strictures therein made, you can
tell. I send it to you for the Perusal of the Members of your
Honbl House. If they have sent into the Army, Boys Negroes & Men
too aged to be fit for any Service they will lay their Hands upon
their Mouths. If not, I hope some decent but keen Pen will
vindicate them from that & other Aspersions. This, like all his
other Letters, is written in such a desponding Stile, that it is
no Wonder if Soldiers decline fighting under him, though they may
be under no Apprehension of Treachery. But he has by this time
receivd his Quietus, at least till he can give a good Account of
his Conduct. Gates has gone to take the Command, and our Affairs
in that Ouarter, I dare say will soon wear another Face.

The Enemies Fleet have been again seen 200 sail off Sinipunxint
15 Leagues South of the Capes of Delaware. I think I have now a
just Demand upon you for a Letter. I shall be disappointed if I
do not receive one by the next Post. Adieu my Friend.

MY DEAR SIR,

The Surrender of Tyconderoga has deeply wounded our Cause. The
Grounds of it must be thoroughly inquired into. The People at
large have a Right to demand it. They do demand it and Congress
have orderd an Inquiry to be made. This Matter must be conducted
with Impartiality. The Troops orderd for the Defence of that Post
were chiefly from New England. It is said there was a great
Deficiency in Numbers--and General Schuyler tells us that a third
Part of the Army there were Boys Negroes and aged Men not fit for
the Field or indeed any other Service, that a great Part of them
were naked, without Blanketts, ill armed & very deficient in
Accoutrements. Such is the Picture he draws. I wish to know as
soon as possible, how many Men actually marchd for that place
from N E, & particularly from Massachusetts Bay. What Quantity of
Cloathing was sent for them & under whose Care; and how they were
furnishd with Arms & Accoutrements. In short I am desirous of
being informd by you as minutely as possible, of the part taken
by Muster Masters Quartermasters Cloathiers & their Agents and
all other Persons employed in making and providing for the Army
in the Northern Department, as far as it has properly fallen
under your Notice & Direction. Excuse me for giving you this
Trouble & be assured that I am very cordially,

your Friend,

MY DEAR BETSY

I was favord with yours of the 2d of this Month by yesterdays
Post. I am much obligd to you for writing to me so often, and
hope you will not omit any future opportunity. [One] or another
of my Boston Friends write to me by every Post, [so] that I think
I should be informd if any extraordinary Accident should happen
to my Family, but I am never so well satisfied as when I receive
one from you. I am in continual Anxiety for your Safety, but am
happy in committing you to the Protection of all gracious Heaven.
May He be your Refuge in every Time of Distress! I had before
heard that the Enemies Fleet was seen off Cape Ann. We had an
Account of it [by] an Express from General Heath, who
contradicted it the [same] Day by another Express. Indeed I did
not give Credit to . . . . News for the British Ships were seen
off the Maryland Shore on the first of August, the very day on
which they were reported to have been seen off Cape Ann. Having
the Command of the Sea, they have it in their Power to give
frequent Alarms to our Seaport Towns. We have not heard of them
since, and it is the opinion of some that they are gone to South
Carolina, but as it is altogether uncertain where they will go,
it is prudent to be ready to receive them in every Place. It is a
Question with me whether they have any Plan upon which they can
depend themselves. I pray God that [their] Councils may be
confounded.

I earnestly hope with you, my Dear, that our . . . . Life is not
always to live at this Distance from each [other] but that we
shall see the happy Day when Tyranny [shall] be subdued and the
Liberty of our Country shall be settled upon a permanent
Foundation. If this is not to be accomplishd in our Day, May we
hereafter meet our virtuous Friends in that blessd Region, where
the wicked shall cease from troubling.

My Love to my dear Daughter, Sister Polly & the rest of my Family
& Friends. Tell my Servants I thank them for their kind
Remembrance of me. I am, my dear,

ever yours,

I have sent the Letter to
Capt M. inclosd in one
to Dr F.
